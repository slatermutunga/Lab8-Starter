How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradtion and service workers are related as they are both used to enhance the user experience. Graceful degradation
makes sure that the site is usuable on all browsers, and service workers allow websites help with faster load times and offline
work. They are also related in that some browsers can't use service workers, so graceful degradation would account for that
and still make sure that the service is functional.
